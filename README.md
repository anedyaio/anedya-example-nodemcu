This repository contains example projects for the ESP8266(NodeMcu) microcontroller utilizing the Anedya APIs. Anedya is a comprehensive cloud platform that offers Platform as a Service (PaaS) for IoT applications. It covers all aspects, including device lifecycle management, data storage, alerts, and data aggregation in a single platform. Anedya simplifies the integration of IoT hardware with the server and eliminates the burden of IoT cloud infrastructure development and management.

## List of the example included:

The examples demonstrate the setup and usage of Anedya with NodeMcu. They include:

- Data submission and visualization on the Anedya cloud via HTTP.
- Data submission and visualization on the Anedya cloud via MQTT.
- Submission of device logs vis HTTP.
- Submission of device logs vis MQTT.
- Device commands control via MQTT.
